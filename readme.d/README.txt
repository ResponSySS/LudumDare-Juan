WHAT IS IT?
 C SFML vidya gaem made for the 28th Ludum Dare with the theme "You Only Get One".

REQUIREMENTS
 All the libraries the executable depends on are in the  lib64  directory (which is bretty crappy, I know).

STRUCTURE
 Sources files are located in  src  and the executable is in  bin  .
 Datas used by the gaem (sprites, music, etc... ) are located in  data  .
 Surprising, huh?

SO, YOU WANNA BUILD IT, EH?
 Go to the  src  directory, and execute the following commands:
  make

SO, YOU WANNA PLAY, EH?
 Just execute the  Juan  executable after you built it.

SO, YOU WANNA STEAL MY SOURCE CODE, EH?
 You will be able to, not right now though. I just have to choose a good FOSS license for them beautiful functions, and it still lacks some polish.
 Notify me if interested in using it; I'll be delighted.

CONTACT
 I'll be more than happy to hear from you, stranger. Maybe we already know each other.
 I'm SyS,  @ResponSyS_  on the Twitter. My email is  saubiersylvain@gmail.com  .


Now, allow me to say Juan final word: thank you for reading this.

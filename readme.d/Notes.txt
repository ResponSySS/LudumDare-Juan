Juan

It's the last day of school. You have to hang out with her.
It's the last day of school. You wear your best costume.
It's the last day of school. Do your best, Juan.

Objective:
	Game over if:
		Others see you tap dancing.
		Nobody sees you tap dancing [for some time].
	You lose life if:
		You don't dance while Carlita only is watching you.
		[Nobody sees you tap dancing]
	You gain points if:
		You dance while Carlita only is watching you.

Execution:
	top-down/slighty iso view
	Juan stands in the middle of the screen
	Other people are randomly placed on the environment
	Carlita is in front of you, sitting on a bench
	
	You don't get to move at all
	It only uses Juan button
		if you press that Juan and unique button, you enable the only one possible action you can make:
			tap-dance for the beautiful eyes of Carlita
	
	Quite often, Carlita and others will switch their focus and look elsewhere
	
	Score isn't displayed, but an arrow helps you:
		turns from red to black when in danger, downward
		turns green when it's all good m8, upward
		disappears when the situation is stable

Theory:
	Score is hidden because love can't be even approximatively quantified. Does she love me? Am I impressing her? Who knows.
	Dancing while she don't watch you is not motivating enough, but you could dance forever is she is there, admiring your dary feet.

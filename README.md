Juan
==============

What is it?
-----------
  C SFML vidya gaem made for the 28th Ludum Dare with the theme *You Only Get One*.

Requirements
------------
  All the libraries the executable depends on are in the  *lib64*  directory (which is bretty crappy, I know).

Structure
---------
  Sources files are located in  *src*  and the executable is in  *bin*  .
  Datas used by the gaem (sprites, music, etc... ) are located in  *data*  .
  Surprising, huh?

SO, YOU WANNA BUILD IT, EH?
---------------------------
  Go to the  *src*  directory, and execute the following command:
   `make`

SO, YOU WANNA PLAY, EH?
-----------------------
  Just execute the  *Juan*  executable after you built it or go to the  *src*  directory, and execute the following command:
   `make play`

SO, YOU WANNA STEAL MY SOURCE CODE, EH?
---------------------------------------
  You will be able to, not right now though. I just have to choose a good FOSS license for them beautiful functions, and it still lacks some polish.
  Notify me if interested in using it; I'll be delighted.

Contact
-------
  I'll be more than happy to hear from you, stranger. Maybe we already know each other.

Now, allow me to say Juan final word: thank you for reading this.
